mxass README, Feb 2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mxass is a 6502/65816/Z80 crossassembler.
See http://www.michael-steil.de/ for more info.

Some notes:
* This is the UNIX/C version of mxass.
* This is not a release version. It assembles the examples, but might
  fail horribly on everything else.
* The manual is outdated. For example, mxass does not support
  the PC64 or 64NET cables any more.
* There are two examples: dia.asm is a C64 diagnostics program
  (German user interface), and x7.asm is the core of the C64 diskmag "X-Dome".
